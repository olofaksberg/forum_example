<!-- @format -->

my idea with this repo is to show some tips that has helped me improve my react code.
most tips will be about handling data from an api, but there will also be some other small examples on, for example, how to make your react app responsive.

you find the examples as branches in this repo. example_one = start code. example_two = some improvments to the code. and so on..
